JAVASCRIPT :
We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically. 
(Value has type, not variable)
Anomaly:
i. JS has a bug on type of null as a object, haven't rectified yet. console.log(typeof null) // return object    // 
Value has two types: 
1. object
a.)
2. primitive:
There are 7 primitive data types: 
a.) number : Floating point numbers - Used for decimals and integers
b.) string : Sequence of characters - Used for text 
c.) boolean : Used for taking decisions 
d.) undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. (empty value).
e.) null : Also means empty value.
f.) symbol (ES2015) : Value that is unique and cannot be changed. 
g.) bigInt (ES2020) : Larger integers than the Number type can hold .


// Mutate a variable ( let is functional scope)
=> let age = 30;
age = 31;

// Cannot mutate (Cannot change the value of const variable. )
const birthYear = 1992;
birthYear = 2000 // Uncaught error 
const job;       // Uncaught error : Missing initializer in const declaration

// Not recommended to use var 
var checkVar = 'Programmer'
checkVar = 'software'  // No error. var is global scope
